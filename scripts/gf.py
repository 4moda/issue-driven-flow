"""Decision logic for issue-driven-flow workflows.

Reads GitHub issue JSON on stdin and prints a result. Keeping the logic
here (stdlib only, no network) makes it unit testable; fetching data and
mutating GitHub state stay in the workflows and composite actions.

Subcommands:
  state              Print the issue's flow/* state label, or "none". Exits
                      2 when the issue carries more than one state label.
  ready              Print "true"/"false" for the "ready for implementation"
                      checkbox.
  route              Print what a workflow should do when the trigger label
                      is added to the issue. --workflow is "shape" or
                      "build"; --trigger-label names the public trigger
                      label (default "flow"); --format github prints
                      GITHUB_OUTPUT-style key=value lines.
  split-parent       Read a sub-issue on stdin, print the split parent's
                      issue number recorded in its body, or an empty line
                      when it has none.
  sub-issue-numbers  Read a split parent issue on stdin, print each
                      sub-issue number from its "## Sub-issues" checklist,
                      one per line.
  split-complete     Read {"parent": <issue>, "siblings": [<issue>, ...]}
                      on stdin, print "true" when every sub-issue listed in
                      the parent's checklist is closed, else "false".
